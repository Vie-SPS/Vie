## Workflow (non-negotiables)
1. Work starts as an Issue.
2. Issues are assigned to an owner.
3. Work happens on a branch per issue.
4. PR must link the issue (`Fixes #123`).
5. PR must pass CI + review before merge.

## Repo Structure
- `docs/meetings/` meeting notes
- `docs/experiments/` experiment tracking + results
- `docs/datasets/` dataset cards + collection notes
- `docs/hardware/` hardware specs + BOM
- `src/` implementation (create as needed)
